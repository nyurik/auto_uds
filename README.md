This crate provides low-level no_std structs and enums of the [Unified Diagnostic Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Diagnostic_Services) specification for the road vehicles iso-14229-1 in Rust.

The code was forked from the amazing [rnd-ash/ecu_diagnostics](https://github.com/rnd-ash/ecu_diagnostics) project. The code was forked from the last MIT-versioned code before the MIT to GPL license migration.
